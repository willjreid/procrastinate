        <h3>Mark Reynoso</h3>
        <p>Mark hails from the Island of Whidbey in the great Pacific Northwest. He has found his way into the wonderful
          world of coding via non-profit fundraising and someday hopes to marry the two paths into some useful technology to benefit those in need.
          For fun, you might find Mark playing on his boat, hiking in the mountains, or just hanging out with his wife Janna and two little boys, Silas and Caleb.</p>

        <h3>Will J. Reid</h3>
        <p>Will has lived in Seattle for almost six years, and he no longer owns an umbrella, so he feels like a true native at this point.

Will lives in Phinney Ridge with his wife, his two beautiful children and his bikes. </p>
