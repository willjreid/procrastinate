# procrastinate
## Procrastinator Generator Project

This project was created during our Code Fellows 201 course. This project consists of a three HTML web pages with unique styling and JS functionality.  It allows a CF201 student to find a video--from 30 seconds to 30 minutes--to help him or her procrastinate more effectively.  After answering seven behavioral-assessment questions, the app delivers a video matching the user's personality ranging from the categories "educational", "diy", "satisfying", "humor" and "self-improvement."

#Getting Started

To get started, clone the repo into your local machine. Run the index.html file to start the landing page.  The landing page will ask for your name (as the "contestant") and will retain your name in local storage.  If you navigate straight to the quiz we will handle your workflow without retaining your name in local storage.

Alternatively you can run the site at *****GH PAGES LINK HERE****

#Prerequisites

You really just need a text editor and a browser. And if you are using IE you should probably rethink your life decisions.

#Running the tests

At this time the system features a JS test coverage level of 0. If developer skill increases and customer demand warrants, we can increase the test coverage up to the industry standard of 80%.

#Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

If you need to deploy the system, just get yourself a GitHub repo, copy the files and images into your repo, then create a branch called gh-pages and you will be able to see the pages running in production. While you're at it, buy something from the GH marketplace at https://github.com/marketplace to help support the site that is hosting your site for free.
