Procrastinator Generator Project





















Problem domain:

So, you have a very important project to work on, but you're looking for a way out (for a short time at least). You need something to take your mind off it. You start surfing the web, and you can't find anything new or interesting to help you procrastinate any further. Wouldn't it be nice if there was a website that catered to your narrow attention span? Here's where our idea comes in. The concept of this website is based off of user input. The user will navigate to our website, and be faced with a prompt that asks their name (to personalize it), then directed to the landing page. It will be filled with style and design like no other. The user arrives at the [about us or survey page?], and start their way through our "in-depth" survey to figure out what will stimulate their mind until their heart's content. The survey will be [7] questions long and will give our functions information needed to generate a [single or multiple] video[s] for their choosing. There will be a number of determining factors:

-What selections they have made.
-How that will determine what video they are directed to.
-What videos will be provided by the dev team.
-[MORE TO BE ADDED]

It is imperative that this website is visually appealing and clean looking to people to draw them in. We also need links to the rest of the website on every page associated with the site to ensure they explore the content.

Because we are early in the life of this business, we will need to build an application that is adaptable. Pat will need to be able to add and remove locations from the daily projections report, and Pat will also need to be able to easily modify the input numbers for each location based on day of the week, special events, and other factors. Pat would like to see these numbers with nice formatting in a web application, and oh yeah... one more thing:

Pat needs you to take a leading role in doing the design work and construction of a public-facing page, too. Pat has a logo image picked out, but that's it. Yep, all you're getting to work off of is an illustration of a fish: -->
